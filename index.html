          <p>Hello everyone! My name is Mayme Clayton and I am a junior web developer. I finished up the Fall 2018 Awesome Inc. Web Development Bootcamp in December 2019 and have been working as a Junior Dev since January at Bluegrass Integrated Communications in Lexington, KY. I love the mix of creativity and technical skill required in web development. I learn something new every day.</p>
          <p>I have been married to my husband, Matthew, for eleven years and we have an adorable 2 year old named Henry. We love spending time together whether it's in our backyard, walking at the Arboretum, or going to events around Lexington. I also enjoy cooking, reading, playing tennis, watching movies and comedy specials, and sleeping.</p>
