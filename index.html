<h1> Mayme Clayton </h1>
<p>Hello everyone! My name is Mayme Clayton and I am an aspiring web developer. I am so excited to be participating in the Fall 2018 Awesome Inc. Web Development Bootcamp and look forward to meeting all of my classmates.</p>
<p>I am married to my high school sweetheart (Matthew) and we have a sweet 14 month old named Henry. We love spending time together whether it's in our backyard, walking at the Arboretum, or going to outdoor events around Lexington. I also enjoy cooking, reading, playing tennis, watching movies and comedy specials, and sleeping.</p>
