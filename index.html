      <div class="card-body">
          <p>Hello everyone! My name is Mayme Clayton and I am a software engineer. In the summer of 2018 I made the decision to switch careers
            from 8 years in Higher Education Financial Aid to the wonderful world of development. The trajectory of my career at that point did
            not excite me and I wanted something challenging that also allowed me to be creative. After extensive research I decided to attend the
            web development bootcamp through Awesome Inc. in Lexington, Kentucky. I graduated in the Fall of 2018
            from the bootcamp after 12 grueling weeks of in-person learning. It was the best decision I've ever made.
          </p>
          <p>Since completing the bootcamp I took a position with Bluegrass Integrated Communications in January 2019 as a web developer. I spend my
          days building and maintaining a variety of sites for our clients. I am leading the development of a new website for Bluegrass using Craft
          as the CMS. We are also in the process of creating a few subsidiary brands for various services we offer and I am developing those with Wordpress.
          </p>
          <p>When I'm not developing for work I have a few side projects that keep me busy. A friend has a home inspection/improvement business and I am
          building a website for him to bring in more business. I am also working with a small start up called Fresh Eyes Solutions on an app they are developing.
          My work is compensated with mentorship and training in technologies that I am interested in learning more about (React most especially).
          </p>
          <p>I have been married to my husband, Matthew, for eleven years and we have an adorable 3 year old named Henry. We love spending time together
            whether it's in our backyard, walking at the Arboretum, or going to events around Lexington. I also enjoy cooking, reading, playing
            tennis, watching movies and comedy specials, and sleeping.</p>
