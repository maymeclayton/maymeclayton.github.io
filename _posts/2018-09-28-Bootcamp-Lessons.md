# Two weeks down...

It is hard to believe that I've been at this for two weeks. Sometimes it feels like no time and others it feels like an eternity has passed. My mind has been stretched, melded, blown, and has kept up. I think. The immense of amount of information being thrown at us is staggering but incredibly interesting and the focus I'm maintaining is a welcome surprise. Here is just a *short* list of the things we've touched on so far:

- Git                   
- Command Line
- HTML
- Sass
- Browser-sync
- JavaScript
- Jekyll                     
- Markdown
- Bootstrap
- CSS
- NPM
- Babel
- CPX
- Design Lesson with Jacqueline
- Canvaa
- Pair Programming

I think the thing that has been most difficult for me at this point is JavaScript. Hearing that word sends shivers down my spine. I've never felt as though logic has been my strongest skill so I already have a predisposed aversion. I've made up my mind that I will get better and, not surprisingly, working through problems has helped. But I have a **LONG** way to go.

I look back on the pre-work phase of this journey and can't believe how much my coding skills have developed in such a short amount of time. Those projects seemed painstaking at the time but today I could knock those out so quickly. That is such a gratifying and productive feeling - I look forward to more moments like that throughout the bootcamp and beyond.
